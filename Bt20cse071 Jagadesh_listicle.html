              DATA BASE MANAGMENT SYSTEM lab is located in the Department of
              Computer Science and Engineering. A DBMS provides facilities for
              controlling data access, enforcing data integrity, managing
              concurrency control, and recovering the database after failures
              and restoring it from backup files, as well as maintaining
              database security.

              Operating System Lab Is located in department of Computer Science
              and Engineering.This course teaches the basic operating system
              abstractions, mechanisms, and their implementations. The core of
              the course contains concurrent programming (threads and
              synchronization), inter process communication, and an introduction
              to distributed operating systems.
